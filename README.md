# Missouri-as-Art
Power point material provides introduction to remote sensing with ample examples of imagery collected in Missouri. With intuitive combination of satellite imagery, the material highlight distinct Missouri landscape, ideal training material for K-16 
### Missouri is a naturally beautiful state, and one of the most stunning ways to visualize Missouri’s beauty is by using different multispectral band combinations to optimize the visualization of remote sensing data to highlight different features on the ground. The Missouri as Art portion of MissouriView’s mission makes remote sensing data more visually intriguing and artistic for building interest from K-12 communities, while introducing students to applied concepts in remote sensing. Here, students are introduced to the Electromagnetic Spectrum, the concepts of remote sensing bands, how different bands are visualized, and how different combinations of bands can highlight features of different types (i.e. water, agriculture, mineral exploration and extraction, etc...).
